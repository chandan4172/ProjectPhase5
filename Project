DESCRIPTION
Project objective:
Amazon Web Services (abbreviated AWS) is a collection of remote computing services (also called web services) that together make a cloud computing platform, offered over the Internet by Amazon for an infrastructure. Let's consider the Swiggy application which uses Devops tools like (Jenkins/Appium/Docker) for improved automated testing infrastructure, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery.
Background of the problem statement:
As a part of cloud and devops CI/CD, the user should have access to sign in to the AWS console to perform create an EC2 instance, S3 bucket, EBS volume, and mounting. Create CI/CD pipeline using AWS, Jenkins, Docker and automate the cloud-based testing for mobile application using appium.
You must use the following:
 
•	AWS console access
•	JAVA 1.8 version
•	Appium
•	Jenkins in EC2 machine
•	Docker in EC2 machine
The following requirements should be met:
 
•	Create Maven project for the Swiggy application. (https://www.swiggy.com/)
•	Write an Appium script.
•	Create an AWS account in console.
•	Set up user/policies in IAM to perform actions with respect to service.
•	Set up SSH and the user should be able to connect the ec2 machine from their local (Mac/Linux).
•	Create an IAM user that can perform to create EC2 instance, S3 bucket, creating EBS volume, and mounting in AWS console.
•	Set up Jenkins server by installing Jenkins in ec2 and by installing required plugins like Docker/Selenium in Jenkins.
•	Set up Docker for containerizing your application on Docker.
•	Create a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins with Appium test cases and containerizing the application using Docker.

Solution
Create Maven project for the Swiggy application. (https://www.swiggy.com/)
o Swiggy mobile application to find the ‘Domino’s Pizza’ scenario is taken for automation. 
o Simulated mobile of Android 11 version was created using Android Studio
 o Device was added with desired capability on the Appium
o Elements were identified using XPath, ID on the Appium Inspector
o Details collected for the Swiggy mobile application is automated using JUnit, Android Driver
